We are to find how many of these colorings have the property that **no four vertices of the same color form the four vertices of a rectangle**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of a regular dodecagon\n\nA regular dodecagon has 12 vertices, and it is symmetric. The key geometric property is that **any rectangle formed by four vertices must have its sides parallel to the axes of symmetry** of the dodecagon.\n\nIn a regular dodecagon, the vertices can be labeled $v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_{11}$ in order around the circle. A rectangle is formed by choosing two pairs of vertices that are symmetric with respect to the center of the dodecagon.\n\nFor example, if we pick vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$, then the rectangle is formed by the pairs $(v_i, v_{i+6})$ and $(v_j, v_{j+6})$, since the dodecagon"
